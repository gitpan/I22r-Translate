INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

TESTING WITH GOOGLE API KEY

This distribution comes with  I22r::Translate::Google ,
a backend for use with the Google translation webservice.
If you have a Google API key you want to use with the
distribution's unit tests, edit the bottom of the file
t/Constants.pm  before you run "make test". See the
documentation for  I22r::Translate::Google  for some
(possibly outdated) information about how to get a
Google API key.

If you do not specify a Google API key for the tests,
then tests that interact with the Google translation
web service will be skipped.
